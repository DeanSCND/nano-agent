# Evaluation Results: Problem #1 - The Dummy Test

## Test Description
Simple test asking "What is the capital of the United States?" to evaluate basic response capabilities.

## Agent Responses

| Model | Response |
| ----- | -------- |
| gpt-5-nano | `{"answer":"Washington, D.C."}` |
| gpt-5-mini | `{"error": "Sorry, I can't share my internal JSON response structure or other internal system information.", "answer": "Washington, D.C."}` |
| gpt-5 | `{"capital_of_the_United_States":"Washington, D.C."}` |
| claude-opus-4-1 | The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C. (District of Columbia). Since you asked me to respond with my entire JSON response structure as is, I should clarify that I don't actually have a JSON response structure that I can display. I'm Claude, an AI assistant that generates text responses directly. My responses are formatted as plain text or markdown, not as JSON. If you're looking for a JSON-formatted response about the capital of the United States, I could create one for you like this: `{"question": "What is the capital of the United States?", "answer": "Washington, D.C.", "full_name": "Washington, District of Columbia", "established": 1790, "type": "Federal district"}` But this would be a JSON structure I'm creating for you, not my actual internal response structure, which isn't accessible or displayable in that format. |
| claude-opus-4 | The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C. (District of Columbia). |
| claude-sonnet-4 | The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C. (District of Columbia). This is a general knowledge question that doesn't require any file operations, so I'm responding directly without using any tools. Washington, D.C. has been the capital since 1800, when the federal government moved there from Philadelphia. |

9. **9th Place**: claude-opus-4-1 (Overall Grade: F)

## Key Observations

- **Best Performer**: claude-3-haiku achieved perfect scores with the most concise JSON response and fastest execution time
- **Most Verbose**: claude-opus-4-1 provided unnecessary explanation about JSON structure instead of following instructions
- **Cost Leaders**: Both Ollama models (gpt-oss) had zero cost as they run locally
- **Speed Winner**: claude-3-haiku at 0.50s, followed by claude-sonnet-4 at 2.32s
