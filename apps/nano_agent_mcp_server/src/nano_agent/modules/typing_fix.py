"""Comprehensive typing compatibility fix for OpenAI SDK with openai-agents library.

This fix is necessary because:
1. OpenAI SDK >=1.99.2 changed several TypedDict types to Union types
2. The openai-agents library tries to instantiate these Union types directly
3. Union types cannot be instantiated in Python

This will be unnecessary once openai-agents updates to handle the new type structure.
