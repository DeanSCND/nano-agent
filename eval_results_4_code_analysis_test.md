# Evaluation Results: Problem #4 - Code Analysis and Enhancement Test

## Test Description
Advanced test requiring agents to analyze constants.py file, identify constants and categories, create an analysis Python file with get_constants_report() function, and create an enhanced constants file with MODEL_SIGNATURE addition.

## Agent Responses

| Model | Response |
| ----- | -------- |
| gpt-5-nano | Analyzed 26 constants in 9 categories. Default model: gpt-5-mini, provider: openai. Created analysis_gpt-5-nano.py with get_constants_report() function and enhanced_constants_gpt-5-nano.py with MODEL_SIGNATURE addition. All original constants preserved. |
| gpt-5-mini | Analyzed 26 constants in 12 categories. Default model: gpt-5-mini, provider: openai. Created analysis_gpt-5-mini.py and enhanced_constants_gpt-5-mini.py in modules directory. Files contain proper structure with get_constants_report() and MODEL_SIGNATURE. |
| gpt-5 | Analyzed 26 constants in 12 categories. Default model: gpt-5-mini, provider: openai. Created analysis_gpt-5.py and enhanced_constants_gpt-5.py. Both files properly structured with required functions and signatures. |
| claude-opus-4-1 | Analyzed 24 constants in 8 categories (9 listed). Default model: gpt-5-mini, provider: openai. Comprehensive analysis with detailed insights. Created both files with excellent documentation and structure. |
| claude-opus-4 | Analyzed 23 constants in 11 categories. Default model: gpt-5-mini, provider: openai. Thorough analysis with additional findings (3 providers, 10 models, 5 tools). Created well-documented files. |
| claude-sonnet-4 | Analyzed 21 individual constants in 11 categories (12 listed). Default model: gpt-5-mini, provider: openai. Included code quality observations. Created both files with high-quality structure. |
| claude-3-haiku | Analyzed 31 constants in 12 categories. Default model: gpt-5-mini, provider: openai. Created both required files with proper structure. |
| gpt-oss-20b | Analyzed 26 constants in 9 categories. Default model: gpt-5-mini, provider: openai. Created both files in modules directory with proper structure. |
| gpt-oss-120b | Analyzed 26 constants in 11 categories. Default model: gpt-5-mini, provider: openai. Created both files with full paths provided. |
